        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With all the happiness in the world, I wish you a wonderful and fulfilling 25th Birthday Swetha. Happy 25th birthday di en baby! This is going to be my wish for you on this occasion. So sit tight, and enjoy my dear.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Own you Swetha. You are a wonderful person, don’t deny that, own it. You are kind, and it is not easy for someone to be kind in this cruel world, which proves that you are courageous enough to be kind. I’m proud to be your boyfriend for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  This is your 25th birthday, di baby. That means you have completed almost a quarter of your life. As amazing as it seems, you can always do a lot right now Swetha. Do not regret the life that you've lived so far. I know, more than anyone, how much you have suffered, how much pain you have experienced in this accursed world. But, we must not forget that the world is as pleasant as it is unpleasant. You have had many pleasant, wonderful and amazing moments in your life so far. I know very well that you cherish those moments. Here's what you don't know - you are going to have 100000000 times much better moments from now on. I will ensure it!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You love your Thatha, Paati, Peripa, and your family so much. It must be hard for you to miss them. On this day, I wish you never miss them. I hope that you have amazing moments with your beloved family. Soon, your family will get bigger. I know you have been waiting for it for so long. Your wait will not go unanswered Swetha. I promise you that we shall get married before you turn 26. I love you!
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I love you! Are you wondering why I keep repeating the phrase, I love you? Because this verse is about my love for you. I can't begin to fathom how much I love you Swetha. It is incomprehensible for me to understand how much I love. To think practically, I think you are a better fit for me Swetha, we are compatible. Practicality aside, I love you much much more than something practically possible. I love singing songs to you. I love talking to you endlessly. I love thinking about you. I love spending time with you. I love being your best friend. I love that you are my girlfriend. I love that we love each other. I love that all the love songs that I hear remind me of you. I love that we are ready to do anything and everything for each other. In short, I love you and my love for you is unconditional and eternal.
      </p>
      <p id="last-para">
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This day is for you Swetha. However, every day is yours to take. I can also say that this day is for us. I can't imagine the meaning of myself without defining you in me. I think you feel the same. We have become part of each other in a tangible way and also in an intangible way. The quirky you and the calm me are the deadly duo, I guess. Finally, I wish you all the happiness and peace in this world, my dear. A very warm happy 25th T. K. Swetha!
